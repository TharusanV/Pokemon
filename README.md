# Java - Pokemon

### Description :
Pokemon I imagine, is a media franchise you are aware off. For myself, I first heard about it from the Nintendo video games. So whilst thinking of a big project to do in Java to pass the time, my mind usually goes to games given them requiring varying functionality and games working well with OOP in my opinion. With that in mind, introducing my pokemon game that was made purely throught Java with no external libraries. 

### Functionality :
    - Movement
    - Collisions
    - NPCs
    - Dialogue with NPCs
    - Battle System
    - Maybe more (I don't know I may add more if I feel like it)
